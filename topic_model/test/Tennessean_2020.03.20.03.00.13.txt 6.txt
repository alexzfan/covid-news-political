Food distribution at Cole Elementary School
Nashville Tennessean
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a pandemic. Reported illnesses range from very mild to severe, including death. Agencies anticipate widespread transmission will occur in the U.S. in coming months and recommend social distancing among other measures to slow the spread. Call your doctor and stay home if you are sick. Get more information at CDC.gov/coronavirus or contact the Tennessee Department of Health coronavirus information line at 877-857-2945 from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. CT daily.
Cole Elementary School volunteers served over 240 families lined up in cars on Wednesday before resources ran out.
Another 90 couldn't be served in the line that formed at noon  some came from other schools where demand also exceeded the supply.
The need from Metro Nashville Public Schools parents for food to feed kids amid school closures to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus has been high for the district.
At Cole, Principal Chad Hedgepath said families rely on the school to serve their kids two meals a day.

But extended school closures from tornadoes and now from the coronavirus are stressing the finances of families, Hedgepath said. Nashville's public schools serve a majority of families that are low-income.
"Grocery stores are lacking affordable options for families," Hedgepath said. "There's not really panic among our families but there's definitely gratefulness for what Metro Schools is doing."

This week, Nashville schools worked with Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle Tennessee to supply food and serve families in a drive-through fashion. Volunteers wore masks to protect themselves from spreading or contracting the coronavirus.
Starting Monday, the district will be able to use federal funds to feed students with to-go boxes. It will serve families in a similar fashion.
Hedgepath said he's prepared for the immense need that will continue to mount due to the coronavirus-related shutdowns.
"You know there are some children in our communities that will go without until someone can provide it for them," Hedgepath said. "It's hard for everybody to understand that concept, but you know there are financial ramifications of this whole virus.
"There are moms and dads that don't have jobs right now because they're in the hospitality business. I think just having the resources through our school system to provide food for our students while they're at home is a lifesaver and it is going to mean the world to our families."
