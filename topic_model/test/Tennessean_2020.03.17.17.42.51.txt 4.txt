The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a pandemic. Reported illnesses range from very mild to severe, including death. Agencies anticipate widespread transmission will occur in the U.S. in coming months and recommend social distancing among other measures to slow the spread.  Call your doctor and stay home if you are sick.

Children and families who rely on food provided by Metro Nashville Public Schools during the week can still access those services while schools are closed in response to the coronavirus outbreak in Nashville. 
The societal changes that are occurring in response to COVID-19 make it all the more important that we find ways to provide for the nutritional needs of the children of Nashville, said Director of Schools Dr. Adrienne Battle in a release. We are so grateful to the community partners who are stepping up in this time of need, and well be exploring as many options as possible to safely provide for the students and families of MNPS.
MNPS plans to be closed until at least April 3.

The waiver allows the state to put into place food distribution methods such as grab-and-go or bus stop delivery, and many school districts in the region are able to provide similar services. 
Beginning March 23, meals will be bagged or boxed and available in a drive-through setup to limit crowds and possible exposure to COVID-19.
The meals will be cold or room temperature to allow for transportation.
Meals will be available to anyone under 18, regardless of their school status. The child must be present to collect the meals, based on federal law.
Meals will be prepared at Cane Ridge High School, John Overton High School, and Haynes Middle School and will be delivered to the following locations for pickup between 8- 9 a.m. for breakfast and 12-1:30 p.m. for lunch:
