When FiftyForward was forced to close its senior centers Monday after the restrictions were put in place on the coronavirus, the question became how to get food to the seniors who counted on the meals they received.
On Tuesday, at the group's Bordeaux center, 3315 John Mallett Drive in Nashville, the Nashville Food Project provided 50 hot meals to members who could either drive up or had food delivered to them.
Its a drive-thru and delivery service that we are doing here at FiftyForward today for our members who usually enjoy a hot meal every day at lunch as part of their membership," said Robin Johnson, director of volunteer services for FiftyForward.
FiftyForward is seeking food donations. For details, go to www.fiftyforward.org.
If an individual needs food help, call 615-743-3416.
