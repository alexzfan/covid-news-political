The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a pandemic. Reported illnesses range from very mild to severe, including death. Agencies anticipate widespread transmission will occur in the U.S. in coming months and recommend social distancing among other measures to slow the spread.  Call your doctor and stay home if you are sick. Get more information at CDC.gov/coronavirus or contact the Tennessee Department of Health coronavirus information line at 877-857-2945 from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. CT daily.
With schools remaining closed because of coronavirus, Metro Nashville Public Schools will be providing breakfast and lunch to children starting on Monday.
In addition to school-based food distribution sites, MNPS will be offering meal delivery at locations in areas experiencing high rates of poverty.
"We know that many of our families wont have access to the transportation necessary to get to one of our school-based distribution locations, so were doing our best to get out into the community and get food to the kids who need it the most," Director of Schools Adrienne Battle said. "Well be implementing social distancing best practices and requirements to reduce the potential for the spread of COVID-19 while we make every effort to provide for the needs of our students and families."

Late Friday, MNPS officials were notified that an employee in the nutrition services division tested positive for COVID-19. The employee is not involved in food preparation nor supervising those who prepare food.
Metro officials said the employee hasn't returned to work since March 16 and experienced no contact with the food or those preparing the food. Based on conversations with the Metro Public Health Department, there is no risk to the food that was prepared.
"The district will be working with the Health Department and our school nurse program to implement additional safety precautions to ensure no employees that have symptoms of illness would be working to prepare or deliver meals," officials said.
